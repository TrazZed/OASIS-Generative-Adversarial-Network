# **GAN Neural Network for Oasis Dataset Image Generation**

This repository demonstrates the application of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the Oasis dataset to produce synthetic brain images. The model leverages the power of deep learning to learn and replicate patterns from medical imaging data.

---

## **Overview**

- The **Oasis dataset** is a collection of brain MRI images used for research purposes in the field of neuroscience and medical imaging.
- A **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** consists of two neural networks:
  - **Generator**: Learns to generate realistic images from random noise.
  - **Discriminator**: Evaluates the generated images against the real dataset, helping the generator improve over time.

This project trains a GAN on the Oasis dataset to generate synthetic brain images while monitoring generator and discriminator loss.

---

## **Features**

- Generates realistic synthetic brain images.
- Visualizes the **Generator** and **Discriminator** loss during training.
- Employs **PyTorch** (or your chosen library) for GAN implementation.
